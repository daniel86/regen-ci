	/**
	 * \brief Base class for OpenGL buffer objects.
	 *
	 * Since the storage for buffer objects
	 * is allocated by OpenGL, vertex buffer objects are a mechanism
	 * for storing vertex data in "fast" memory (i.e. video RAM or AGP RAM,
	 * and in the case of PCI Express, video RAM or RAM),
	 * thereby allowing for significant increases in vertex throughput
	 * between the application and the GPU.
	 *
	 * A memory pool of pre-allocated GPU storage is used in combination
	 * with a memory manager to avoid fragmentation.
	 * Each time alloc is called the memory pool is asked to provide a free block
	 * that fits the size request. As a result you can not be sure to get contiguous memory
	 * if you call alloc multiple times. Each allocation reserves a block of contiguous memory
	 * but blocks do not have to follow each other, they may not even be part of the same
	 * GL buffer object.
